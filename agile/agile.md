## The 12 Principles *(not verbatim)* and Values:
*  **New and reduced role for manager**
No assignment of tasks to project members by project manager. The team self-organises itself instead.

> 11. **Do not over-manage developers**; the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals giving them the environment they need, **support, and trust**.

*  **No "Big Upfront" steps**
Coding to produce software starts right away. Design and reevaluation of requirements are assessed continuously during the coding process instead of being fixed from the start.

> 1. Highest priority is to **satisfy customer** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

> 3. **Deliver working software frequently**; give preference to shorter timescales.

*  **Iterative development**
Project members communicate on a regular basis. For example, every day, or every few days, or every few weeks depending on the scope of the project in a more progressive way. *i.e.* Development cycles should last from one day to a few weeks requiring each cycle to have elicitation, design, development, and testing on a usually limited scope.

> 4. Business people and developers should **work together**.

> 2. Welcome changing requirements, *even late in development*. The **ability to change gives competitive advantage**.

> 6. **Face-to-face conversation** is the most efficient and effective way for *conveying information*.

> 8. Promote sustainable development: **maintaining constant pace**; *and avoid crunch?*

> 12. Communicate to **reflect on successes and failures** in order to **adjust team behaviour accordingly**.

*  **Limited, negotiated scope**
System does exactly what's needed *i.e.* build functionality that is strictly needed; this reduces waste (virtual and physical).

> 10. **Simplicity** *-the art of maximising the amount of work not done-* is essential; write simple code as much as you can, or in other words do not leave your code complicated and personal, make it simple, easy to read, and accessible (in terms of readability) to everyone.

> **Negotiator Scope**
> [Beck 05] Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck, Cynthia Andres
> 
>>
>> Write contracts for software development that fix time, costs, and quality but call for **ongoing negotiation** of the precise scope of the system. Reduce risk by signing a **sequence of short contracts** instead of one long one.
>>
>
>> You can move in the direction of negotiated scope. Big, long contracts can be split in half or thirds, with the optional part to be exercised only if both parties agree. Contracts with high costs for change requests can be written with less scope fixed up front and lower costs for changes.
>
> In other words, (blind) commitment to (both) delivery date and a specific set of functionalities do not mix well. Sometimes focusing on delivery date while forgoing some functionalities is needed while other times delivery date needs to be flexible in regards to a certain set of functionalities. 

*  **Focus on quality achieved through testing**
Testing makes for better quality products.

> 7. (Tested) **Working software** is the **primary measure of progress**.

> 9. **Continuous attention** to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

## Agile Methods/Methodologies
*  Extreme Programming (**XP**)
Response to UML (Unified Modelling Language) and CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) etc. that emphasize process and documentation; but **what matters is the program and programming**

*  **Lean** Software
Made for engineering fields, especially the car industry. **Get rid of waste** (ex. useless documentation, ...); **concentrate on what is delivered to customer**

*  **Crystal** Methodology
Set of methods with various degrees of importance to process

*  **SCRUM** (most widely adopted)
Management method emphasizing ideas via **self-organising teams** (compared to closely managed one) and short release interations (**Sprints**)
