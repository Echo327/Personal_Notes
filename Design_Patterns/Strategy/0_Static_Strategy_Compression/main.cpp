/*
data processing system that processes large datasets (such as CSV, JSON, or XML files)
the system is designed to always use ZIP compression to compress the output files
The ZIP compression algorithm would be hard-coded into the application,
and the system would always use it for every file processed

in this case, the strategy for compressing files (ZIP) is determined at compile time
and does not change based on user input or the file type.
Even if the application is capable of processing multiple file formats,
the compression strategy remains fixed (ZIP) throughout the application's lifecycle.
